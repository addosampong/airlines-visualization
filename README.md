# Investigating and Visualizing Airline Flight Data
## by Evans Addo-Sampong


## Dataset

The data set explored in this project is a 2008 flight data. 
The data set is large with over 2.3 million rows and 29 columns. 
It comtains about 2.3 million instances of data on flights for the year 2008. The data include such flight features  
as the month of the flight, day of the month of the flight, day of the week of the flight, 
carrirer (airline), flight destination, flight origin and flight delay factors/reasons. 
The dataset was obtained from 
[Havard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7#)


## Summary of Findings

The data exploration produced some worthy isights, including the following:

1. February had the least number of flights in 2008, whereas March had the most.
2. The last days of the month saw significantly less number of flights recorded.
3. Most flights took place mid-week than on weekends.
4. WN Airlines recorded the most number of flights with 16.7% of the total number of recorded flights.
5. Of the factors that contribute to cancellation of flights, carrier delays account for 41%. No flights were canceled due to security reasons. 
6. Although WN had the most number of flights in 2008, they recorded very low flight cancellations. Carrier AA had by far the most number of flight cancellations.
7. WN had the most diverted flights in 2008 with 854 flight diversions
8. B6 and CO had the most flight delays by NAS
9. HA had the most flight delays occasioned by carrier delays
10. OH and EV carriers had the most flight delays by occasioned by (poor) weather conditions
11. Quite a number of carriers had a lot of aircraft delays but WN, UA, FL and AS had the highest of recorded delays as a result of aircraft delay.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The focus of this exploratory analysis was on the flight carriers and how they fared in 2008.

Notable among the insights from the analysis is that, even though WN airlines had the highest number of recorded flights in 2008, they recorded the lowest number of cancelled flights. Wihtout making any concrete inference, it could be argued that travelers may have prefereed WN to the other carriers because booked flights with WN were less likely to be cancelled. Further investigations into the correlation between number of cancelled flights and number of recorded flights could give better insights into the relationship between number of recorded flights by a carrier and the number of cancelled flights by that carrier.
